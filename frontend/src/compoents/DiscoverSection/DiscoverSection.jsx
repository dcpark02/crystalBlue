        answer="A report by the World Benchmarking Alliance found that nearly half of the 229 major global corporations surveyed had at least one allegation of a serious human rights issue levied against them, but only four percent of companies adequately remedied the situation with the victim. The report also highlighted that the automotive industry earned the worst ranking since the benchmark was first published in 2017."

Some articles suggest that the Foxconn debacle highlights the need for regulatory intervention and non-compliance to be punished. However, other sources criticize ESG reporting as a false construct that skews free markets and creates undue influence."
